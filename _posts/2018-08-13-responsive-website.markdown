## Professional web design and eCommerce website design
Your website is the core anchor for your digital business and marketing efforts. Having a great website user experience requires understanding the problems different visitors have to solve. And there is a difference between responsive design and a completely separate mobile website. Both can be beneficial at times. If you want the same content on your mobile website as on your desktop of your website, responsive design is the way to go.

## Rank higher in mobile search results
But, if you're looking for a mobile version that is extremely limited or a stripped down version of your full website, a separate mobile version may be a better option. The advantage to responsive design is that it allows the website to use the same code and same files for all displays, while a true mobile version is a separate code base.

## Best user experience for increased online revenue
As mobile and tablet traffic continues to grow at a rapid pace, the need to have a site optimized for these devices is a necessity. Whether you have an informational website or an eCommerce website, responsive design allows for your customers to easily view, navigate and ultimately purchase from your business online.

## App-like website feel & functionality
With responsive design the need for a separate mobile site and tablet optimized website is eliminated and your website will automatically "adapt" to the device it is being viewed on. You'll end up with a site that looks great on a mobile device, tablet, desktop computer and everything in between.
