"Our web site was done very professionally. We like the layout and the time frame was great. Also, the price was very reasonable. Thanks for all your time and effort you put into this. We probably wouldn't have a website even now if we didn't find out about you." - <a href="https://shishutours.fun" target="_blank"><i>shishutours.fun</i></a>

## Make the most of your website
Your conversion rate is very possibly the most important website statistic. The website conversion rate is the number that affects your bottom line and drives the growth of your business. MyBetterWeb specializes in turning your eCommerce website visitors into customers via our website conversion rate optimization service.

## Optimize the user experience and call to action
Through our team's expertise and analytical testing, we determine what changes your website needs in order to perform above and beyond industry standards. Whether you have an eCommerce website and are selling products online, or you're a service based business looking to increase leads, we've worked with clients who have faced the same scenarios that you're facing now. With ever-growing competition in the online space, it's important to stay on top of your game and have a company dedicated to your ongoing success.

## SEO & conversion rate optimization effects
Understanding the connection between SEO and conversion rate is critical in any conversion optimization campaign. When searching on the web users are more likely to click and convert on results at the top. Typically, web users that go to the bottom of page 1 or to page 2, are merely "window shopping" and are not serious buyers. This connection drives down conversion rates and leads to worthless traffic. At MyBetterWeb our goal is to combine conversion rate optimization with SEO efforts to create a campaign that ranks, converts and sells your business better.

### How is conversion rate optimization works?
**1. Website audit**

The conversion rate optimization process is similar to a search engine optimization experience. We start by having MyBetterWeb team members review your website and put together "red flag" items. These are issues that we understand to be major issues from the beginning.

**2. Filter data**

After we realize these and review them with the client, we fix the issues and move into an analytical phase.

**3. Analysis site**

Analytics allow us to determine traffic and visitor patterns on your website. Typical questions we ask are, "Where are visitors leaving?", "Why are they not checking out?" and "How can we be sure they call you?".

**4. Fine tuning**

By looking at statistics we can figure out where weak spots are in your website and begin to implement improvements.

**5. Optimize further**

It's an ongoing process of making changes, analyzing the results and continuing to increase the conversion rate month after month.
