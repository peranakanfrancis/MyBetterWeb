## Engage with the viewer
An explainer video (also known as a homepage video, overview video or conversion video) is designed to explain your company, product, service or subject in a way that your audience can understand in two minutes or less. Most explainer videos cover four key points: the problem, the solution, the features and benefits, and how the solution works.

## More than just explainer videos
The key to a solid explainer video is keeping it short and engaging, while still conveying the right information. No matter what you’re explaining, an explainer video should leave your viewers with a clear understanding of what you do and a desire to take the next step.


## Create a concept for an explainer video
Using animation to explain your best features, you can imaginatively show the real differences between you and your nearest competitors - while we work unflaggingly to develop the brilliant script & images you need to keep on winning.

### Explainer animation video
You can demonstrate how your process or products work by telling a story. Or use animated characters to relate to your customers. Explainer Videos can take on a ‘tell not sell’ approach to educate your audience - or go route one with a full-on sales message.

### Infographic video
If your message has a lot of data or needs to explain a complex solution - then explain it clearly with an infographic video. By showcasing your stats & business processes you’ll generate a credible proof of claim that will give buyers peace of mind. An Infographic Video is a uniquely visual style - built from a foundation of animated captions and charts in a persuasive clear way.

#### How animation video editing works?

1. _Brief_ - tell us your ideas and we’ll respond with creativity ideas, you can make a 25 % deposit before project is commence.

2. _Talk_ - have a one-to-one with an experienced animator and illustrator who are there to listen.

3. _Meet_ - exchange ideas over meeting (or online meeting) so the video message and your brand are in tune.

4. _Script approval_ - Most important part of the process. The right words for your audience.

5. _Storyboard_ - images to go with the script. See on paper exactly how it will look.

6. _Production_ - collaboration continues and the team get to work. Animator, editor, sound artist.

7. _The Show_ - it’s 100% ready and exactly what you want, take a bow. You did it!
