<h3 id="how-does-adwords-campaign-management-work">How does AdWords campaign management work?</h3>
<p><strong>1. Paid Campaign Analysis &amp; Implementation</strong></p>

<p>With an established Ads account we will analyze historical data to find what performs most favorably, and tailor other parts to perform in a similar fashion. We will then change bidding options, keywords, ad text, and destination links to align with our goals. The goal is to drive as many leads and/or sales as possible per dollar spent.</p>

<p><strong>2. Conversion Tracking &amp; ROI Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Our reports show which keywords are creating leads or sales and which are not. We monitor this to be sure we are focusing on the keywords that are working best and targeting specific phrases.</p>

<p><strong>3. Search Network Advertising</strong></p>

<p>We monitor progress and engagement of your search network advertising to adjust bigs, ads, and keywords to best reflect the traffic that will engage most positively on your site.</p>

<p><strong>4. Ad Variation &amp; Testing</strong></p>

<p>Multiple ads will be tested using A/B testing methods to determine which ads lead to the highest click-through and conversion rates. We will also develop landing pages, copy variations and test which work best.</p>

<p><strong>5. Monthly Maintenance</strong></p>

<p>All aspects of the account will be reviewed each month to determine what areas can be improved and to be sure the campaign is running smoothly. Negative keywords and changes to your keywords will constantly be made to improve results.</p>
